# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### 📌 Prodigy InfoTech – Internship Task 2

---

## 📄 Task Objective

Create a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior.

This unsupervised machine learning model helps in understanding customer segments, which can be used for:
- Personalized marketing
- Improved customer experience
- Product recommendation strategies

---

## 📊 Dataset Used

**Source:** Kaggle  
🔗 [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

This dataset contains the following customer features:
- `CustomerID`
- `Genre`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Imported dataset and checked basic info, nulls, and statistics
2. **Data Visualization**
   - Used scatter plots, histograms, and pairplots to understand distributions
3. **Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing data and encoded categorical variables
4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Used `Elbow Method` to find optimal number of clusters (k)
   - Applied KMeans and segmented customers
5. **Cluster Visualization**
   - Plotted clusters using `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`
6. **Interpretation**
   - Analyzed clusters to understand customer groups

---

## 📌 Results

- Identified meaningful customer segments based on income and spending behavior
- Cluster insights can help in **targeted marketing strategies**
